# Intrusion-Detection : Face Detection and Recognition Surveillance System

## Project Overview
This repository hosts an advanced surveillance system leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for enhanced face detection and recognition. It integrates Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) for face detection and the FaceNet model for recognition, tailored for high efficiency and accuracy in diverse surveillance scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Face Detection**: Implements MTCNN for accurate detection of faces in various environments.
- **Accurate Face Recognition**: Uses FaceNet for precise recognition, comparing detected faces against a pre-defined database.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of handling live feeds and pre-recorded video content.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes a GUI for easy interaction, enabling video uploads and live detection display.
- **Multi-Threaded Operations**: Ensures responsive performance through effective threading.
- **Agile Development**: Developed with flexibility and iterative enhancement in mind.
